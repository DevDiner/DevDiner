- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevDiner
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of blockchain, AI, and full-stack development. I also love traveling, trying out new foods, and pushing my limits in fitness, especially through CrossFit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced blockchain protocols, AI-driven technologies, and enhancing my full-stack development skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative tech projects, hackathons, and anything that challenges the norm.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me via demosampleacc@gmail.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a foodie who’s always on the hunt for the next best meal, and I’ll try anything as long as it’s good!
